# XMLExampleProject

Example project for class about XML:

* Well-formed checker
* Validate against DTD
* Validate against XSD
* Marshalling and UnMarshalling (Two examples)
* XPath 
* XQuery

These are just examples about the use of these functions, they don't constitute a proper project and it's not a well designed project nor a sample of how a project should be structured.
